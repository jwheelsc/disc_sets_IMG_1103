there are three obvious sets here.
1-one set going from top left to bottom right at a roughly 20 degree angle
2-one set going bottom left to top right (almost perpendicular to first) 
3-a third set or random or curvy features that likley defines the set perpendicular to the field of view

set 3 appears as though it could be more dense than the first 2, so the apparaent fracture
density is likely greatly undersestimated
furthermore, I am mapping an area that is intact, whereas most of the basin is likely not,
so where i am mapping the fracture intensity is likely less

joints tend to end in eachother to produce blocks, and blcoks are often already segregrated
